## ✨ Project Overview

This portfolio template focuses on **clarity, hierarchy, and visual balance** rather than heavy graphics or frameworks.  
The design follows an **editorial approach**, using typography, spacing, and subtle motion to create personality while remaining neutral enough to be easily customized.

The template does **not include real projects or images**, making it ideal as a reusable base that can be adapted to different users, styles, or content.
