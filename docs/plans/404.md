# 404 Page — Planning Document

## Purpose

The purpose of the 404 error page is to provide a clear and calm response when a user navigates to a non-existing route within the portfolio template. Instead of showing a generic browser error, the page is designed to maintain visual consistency with the rest of the site and guide the user back to relevant content.

---

## Design Goals

- Maintain the same **editorial and minimal aesthetic** as the main template
- Avoid visual noise or heavy graphics
- Communicate the error clearly without creating frustration
- Provide simple navigation options to continue browsing the site

---

## Visual Approach

The 404 page will follow a **simple and centered layout**, relying on typography and spacing rather than imagery.

Planned visual elements:

- Small eyebrow text indicating an error state
- Large “404” heading as the main focal point
- Short explanatory sentence
- One or two clear call-to-action buttons

The design will reuse the same color palette, typography, and button styles already defined in the main template to ensure consistency.

---

## Content Structure

Planned structure of the page:

1. Main content

   - Eyebrow label (e.g. “Error”)
   - Main heading: “404”
   - Short descriptive text explaining that the page was not found
   - Primary button linking back to the homepage
   - Secondary button linking to the projects section

2. Footer
   - Reuse the existing footer structure
   - Include a back-to-top or home link

---

## Interaction & Accessibility Considerations

- Buttons and links will be fully keyboard accessible
- Focus states will be clearly visible
- Text will remain readable with sufficient contrast
- No heavy animations will be used
- The page will respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings

---

## Technical Implementation Plan

- Create a `404.html` file at the root of the project
- Reuse the same CSS file as the main template
- Add only minimal, page-specific styles if needed
- Ensure GitHub Pages serves the custom 404 page automatically

---

## Expected Outcome

The final 404 page should feel like a natural extension of the portfolio template rather than an isolated error screen. It should reinforce the project’s focus on clarity, usability, and thoughtful design, even in edge cases.
