# Project Inspiration

## Trends

- **Minimal & Editorial Web Design**  
  A design approach that prioritizes typography, spacing, and hierarchy over decorative elements. This trend focuses on clarity, readability, and a timeless aesthetic, making it especially suitable for portfolio websites.

- **Fluid Typography and Responsive Layouts**  
  The use of fluid typography with `clamp()` and flexible grid systems allows content to adapt smoothly across screen sizes. This trend improves accessibility and ensures a consistent visual experience on different devices.

- **Subtle Motion and Micro-interactions**  
  Instead of heavy animations, the project incorporates small, intentional interactions such as hover states, smooth scrolling, and gentle transitions. These details enhance usability and add personality without distracting from the content.

## Theme Draft

The core concept of this project is to create a **neutral yet expressive portfolio template** that highlights structure, clarity, and design fundamentals.  
Rather than focusing on individual projects or imagery, the template emphasizes layout, typography, and usability as the main design tools. The result is a flexible foundation that can be adapted by different designers while maintaining a professional and editorial visual language.
